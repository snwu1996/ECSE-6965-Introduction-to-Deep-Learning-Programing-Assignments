    "# Deep Learning - Programing Assignment 2\n",
    "# Neural Networks\n",
    "By Shu-Nong Wu | RIN: 661371234 | RCS: wus7\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n",
    "Programing assignment 1 dealt with logistic regression where the input layer of 785 nodes $X$ is multiplied by a weights and bias matrix $\\theta$ and softmaxed to produce a predicted output $\\hat{Y}$.\n",
    "$$\\hat{Y} = \\sigma_m(\\theta^TX)$$\n",
    "However due to the fact that there is only 785x10 weights and biases the logistic regression model was only able to store a limited amount data for making predictions. In other words the **capacity** of the model was too small to support the complexity of the data. If the capacity is too small the model will underfit the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n",
    "To increase the capacity **hidden layers** must be added between the input and output layer of the logistic regression model turning into a **neural network**. Each layer is fully connected to the next layer thus adding more weights and biases. \n",
    "<img src=\"report_pictures/nn_model.png\">\n",
    "$$Source: Lecture$$\n",
    "To get the value of nodes in the hidden layer $H^l$ the value of the previous layer $H^{l-1}$ must be multiplied by weights $W^l$ and added to the biases $W^l_0$. Finally this result must be passed through an activation function $\\phi(x)$. For the first hidden layer $H^1$, $H^0$ is just $X$. The activation function will be explained later in this report.\n",
    "$$H^l = \\phi({W^l}^TH^{l-1}+W^l_0)$$\n",
    "For the output layer the activation function that will be used is the softmax function. As mentioned earlier a neural network is able to support more weights and biases and is therefore able to create more complex higher order functions that map input to output. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n",
    "In the first programing assignment the goal was to minimize the loss function by taking the gradient of the loss with respects to $\\theta$, multiplying it by the learning rate, and subtracting it back to $\\theta$.\n",
    "$$ \\theta^{t+1} = \\theta^{t} - \\eta\\frac{\\partial(L(D,\\theta))}{\\partial(\\theta)}\\Big|_{\\theta=\\theta^t} $$\n",
    "This approach known as gradient descent will iteratively reduce the loss function thus making prediction more accurate. For neural networks, gradient descent is used to minimize loss by computing the gradient of all the weights, biases, and hidden node. $\\nabla W^{L+1}, \\nabla W_0^{L+1}, \\nabla H^L$ are the gradients of the weights, biases of the output layer. $\\nabla W^{l+1}, \\nabla W_0^{l+1}, \\nabla H^l$ are the gradients of the weights, biases of the hidden layers. These gradients are calculated, multiplied by the learning rate $\\eta$, and subtracted to the weights and biases (but not the hidden layers). For every iteration, the weights and biases are changed such that they cause a small decrease in the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n",
    "Using a model that is too simple relative to the data causes under fitting. The other side of that coin is when too complex of a model is being used on data that is too simple. This results in over fitting when the model is conforms to the training data points too well but is not able to generalize to outside data sets. Because neural networks have more weights biases and therefore more complexity, it is subject to over fitting. There are two ways to mitigate this issue **regularization** and **dropout**. Regularization can be done by calculating the derivative of the L1 or L2 norm of the weights and biases, multiplying it by the regularization weighting $\\nabla$ and adding it to its gradient. The final equation for updating weights and biases are\n",
    "$$ W^l[t+1] = W^l[t] - \\eta\\bigg[\\nabla{W^l}[t]+\\lambda \\frac{\\partial{R(W^l[t])}}{\\partial{W^l[t]}}\\bigg] $$\n",
    "$$ W^l_0[t+1] = W^l_0[t] - \\eta\\bigg[\\nabla{W^l_0}[t]+\\lambda \\frac{\\partial{R(W^l_0[t])}}{\\partial{W^l_0[t]}}\\bigg] $$\n",
    "Dropout reduces the complexity of the model by randomly selecting hidden nodes with probability *p* and disabling the it along with it links. This is done every training iteration and results in a simpler model and avoid over fitting.\n",

    "Much like logistic regression, neural networks need well-tuned hyper parameters in order to converge quickly and accurately. Learning rate is multiplied to the gradients before they are subtracted to the weights and biases. Changing the learning rate will affect how big of a leap the weights and biases move towards its optimal values. If it is too small then it will take a long time to converge if it is too large then the weights and biases will overshoot it optimal value. $\\lambda$ will affect the how dominant the regularization term will be. Number of epoch is referring to how many stochastic gradient descent iterations the model will be trained through. Batch size refers to how much data is being feed into the model in one iteration of training. Finally the number of nodes in the hidden layers must be specified. Increasing the number of nodes increases the capacity of the model but also increases the complexity and computational cost to run the model."
